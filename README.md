# Usage
## Using on Real Hardware
Coming soon!

## Using on VICE
Download and install [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/index.html#download) for your system. Once installed, open x64 (faster) or x64sc (more accurate).

Go to "Preferences" -> "Settings ..." -> "Machine" -> "ROM", and under the "Machine ROMs" tab, point the "chargen" field to the font you would like to select. You can either type in the path manually or use the "Browse ..." button.

Once you've selected the font you want, you can close out of the settings page. By default, the settings will not save once you exit the emulator. If you wish to make the font permanent, you can either click "Preferences" -> "Save settings" to save your settings manually, or go back to "Preferences" -> "Settings ..." and check the box that says "Save settings on exit".
